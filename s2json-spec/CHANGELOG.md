# S2JSON Spec Changelog

## 1.0.0

Initial release.

Rough estimation of the changes from GeoJSON:

* Properties data is clearly defined on how it can be shaped.
* 🧊 Support for 3D geometries.
* ♏ Support for M-Values for each geometry point.
* ♻️ Feature Properties & M-Values are defined in scope to ensure they can be easily processed by lower level languages as structures, but also adds value to other projects down the line.
* 🛑 GeoJSON no longer supports `GeometryCollection`.
