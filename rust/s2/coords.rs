// This file contains documentation of the various coordinate systems used
// throughout the library.  Most importantly, S2 defines a framework for
// decomposing the unit sphere into a hierarchy of "cells".  Each cell is a
// quadrilateral bounded by four geodesics.  The top level of the hierarchy is
// obtained by projecting the six faces of a cube onto the unit sphere, and
// lower levels are obtained by subdividing each cell into four children
// recursively.  Cells are numbered such that sequentially increasing cells
// follow a continuous space-filling curve over the entire sphere.  The
// transformation is designed to make the cells at each level fairly uniform
// in size.
//
//
////////////////////////// S2Cell Decomposition /////////////////////////
//
// The following methods define the cube-to-sphere projection used by
// the S2Cell decomposition.
//
// In the process of converting a latitude-longitude pair to a 64-bit cell
// id, the following coordinate systems are used:
//
//  (id)
//    An S2CellId is a 64-bit encoding of a face and a Hilbert curve position
//    on that face.  The Hilbert curve position implicitly encodes both the
//    position of a cell and its subdivision level (see s2cell_id.h).
//
//  (face, i, j)
//    Leaf-cell coordinates.  "i" and "j" are integers in the range
//    [0,(2**30)-1] that identify a particular leaf cell on the given face.
//    The (i, j) coordinate system is right-handed on each face, and the
//    faces are oriented such that Hilbert curves connect continuously from
//    one face to the next.
//
//  (face, s, t)
//    Cell-space coordinates.  "s" and "t" are real numbers in the range
//    [0,1] that identify a point on the given face.  For example, the point
//    (s, t) = (0.5, 0.5) corresponds to the center of the top-level face
//    cell.  This point is also a vertex of exactly four cells at each
//    subdivision level greater than zero.
//
//  (face, si, ti)
//    Discrete cell-space coordinates.  These are obtained by multiplying
//    "s" and "t" by 2**31 and rounding to the nearest u32eger.
//    Discrete coordinates lie in the range [0,2**31].  This coordinate
//    system can represent the edge and center positions of all cells with
//    no loss of precision (including non-leaf cells).  In binary, each
//    coordinate of a level-k cell center ends with a 1 followed by
//    (30 - k) 0s.  The coordinates of its edges end with (at least)
//    (31 - k) 0s.
//
//  (face, u, v)
//    Cube-space coordinates in the range [-1,1].  To make the cells at each
//    level more uniform in size after they are projected onto the sphere,
//    we apply a nonlinear transformation of the form u=f(s), v=f(t).
//    The (u, v) coordinates after this transformation give the actual
//    coordinates on the cube face (modulo some 90 degree rotations) before
//    it is projected onto the unit sphere.
//
//  (face, u, v, w)
//    Per-face coordinate frame.  This is an extension of the (face, u, v)
//    cube-space coordinates that adds a third axis "w" in the direction of
//    the face normal.  It is always a right-handed 3D coordinate system.
//    Cube-space coordinates can be converted to this frame by setting w=1,
//    while (u,v,w) coordinates can be projected onto the cube face by
//    dividing by w, i.e. (face, u/w, v/w).
//
//  (x, y, z)
//    Direction vector (S2Point).  Direction vectors are not necessarily unit
//    length, and are often chosen to be points on the biunit cube
//    [-1,+1]x[-1,+1]x[-1,+1].  They can be be normalized to obtain the
//    corresponding point on the unit sphere.
//
//  (lon, lat)
//    Latitude and longitude (lonlat).  Latitudes must be between -90 and
//    90 degrees inclusive, and longitudes must be between -180 and 180
//    degrees inclusive.
//
// Note that the (i, j), (s, t), (si, ti), and (u, v) coordinate systems are
// right-handed on all six faces.

// S2 is a namespace for constants and simple utility functions that are used
// throughout the S2 library.  The name "S2" is derived from the mathematical
// symbol for the two-dimensional unit sphere (note that the "2" refers to the
// dimension of the surface, not the space it is embedded in).

/// This is the number of levels needed to specify a leaf cell.  This
/// constant is defined here so that the S2::Metric class and the conversion
/// functions below can be implemented without including s2cell_id.h.  Please
/// see s2cell_id.h for other useful constants and conversion functions.

/// We have implemented three different projections from cell-space (s,t) to
/// cube-space (u,v): linear, quadratic, and tangent.  They have the following
/// tradeoffs:
///
///   Linear - This is the fastest transformation, but also produces the least
///   uniform cell sizes.  Cell areas vary by a factor of about 5.2, with the
///   largest cells at the center of each face and the smallest cells in
///   the corners.
///
///   Tangent - Transforming the coordinates via atan() makes the cell sizes
///   more uniform.  The areas vary by a maximum ratio of 1.4 as opposed to a
///   maximum ratio of 5.2.  However, each call to atan() is about as expensive
///   as all of the other calculations combined when converting from points to
///   cell ids, i.e. it reduces performance by a factor of 3.
///
///   Quadratic - This is an approximation of the tangent projection that
///   is much faster and produces cells that are almost as uniform in size.
///   It is about 3 times faster than the tangent projection for converting
///   cell ids to points or vice versa.  Cell areas vary by a maximum ratio of
///   about 2.1.
///
/// Here is a table comparing the cell uniformity using each projection.  "Area
/// ratio" is the maximum ratio over all subdivision levels of the largest cell
/// area to the smallest cell area at that level, "edge ratio" is the maximum
/// ratio of the longest edge of any cell to the shortest edge of any cell at
/// the same level, and "diag ratio" is the ratio of the longest diagonal of
/// any cell to the shortest diagonal of any cell at the same level.  "ToPoint"
/// and "FromPoint" are the times in microseconds required to convert cell ids
/// to and from points (unit vectors) respectively.  "ToPointRaw" is the time
/// to convert to a non-unit-length vector, which is all that is needed for
/// some purposes.
