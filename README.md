## About

S2JSON is a format for encoding a variety of geographic data structures that simplifies the GeoJSON spec and builds ontop of it to include S2 Geometry.

Notable features of S2JSON are:

* Properties data is clearly defined on how it can be shaped.
* üßä Support for 3D geometries.
* ‚ôè Support for M-Values for each geometry point.
* ‚ôªÔ∏è Feature Properties & M-Values are defined in scope to ensure they can be easily processed by lower level languages as structures, but also adds value to other projects down the line.
* GeoJSON no longer supports `GeometryCollection`.

This spec also extends the spec to include M-Values, Attribution,

// GeoJSON example
{

  "geometry": {
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [125.6, 10.1]

  "properties": {

## Development

### Requirements

You need the tool `tarpaulin` to generate the coverage report. Install it using the following command:

```bash
cargo install cargo-tarpaulin
```

The `bacon coverage` tool is used to generate the coverage report. To utilize the [pycobertura](https://pypi.org/project/pycobertura/) package for a prettier coverage report, install it using the following command:

```bash
pip install pycobertura
```

### Running Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
# TYPESCRIPT
## basic test
bun run test
## live testing
bun run test:dev

# RUST
## basic test
cargo test
# live testing
bacon test
```

### Generating Coverage Report

To generate the coverage report, use the following command:

```bash
cargo tarpaulin
# bacon
bacon coverage # or type `l` inside the tool
```
